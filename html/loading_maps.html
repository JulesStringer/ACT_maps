        <h1>Loading maps</h1>
        <p>Most mapping is derived from freely available layers from OS Open data in standard formats including shp.
            Often the download package covers a larger area than is needed for our purposes.
            As server space is limited we don't want to load more than is necessary.
            Ideally we want mapping in geojson format for display, so a conversion is needed.
            A widely used utility for performing this conversion is ogr2ogr which can perform a filtered conversion between formats including
            shp to geojson.
        </p>
        <p>Siteground allows SSH access, but not root access so It is not possible to install ogr2ogr on siteground.</p>
        <p>This means that map processing needs to be done on another machine prior to uploading the processed maps to 
            siteground. This is probably as well because map processing tends to be resource intensive.
        </p>
        <h2>Maploader utility</h2>
        <p>Preliminary map loading is performed by map loader, which can be downloaded from:
            <a href="https://github.com/JulesStringer/maploaders/" >map loader</a> script</p>
